# Bluetooth Gamepad Fix Summary

## Issues Resolved

### 1. Stats Overlay Toggle (FIXED âœ…)
- **Problem**: Stats overlay ('v' key) wasn't working in performance mode
- **Root Cause**: Performance optimizations were blocking stats overlay functionality
- **Solution**: Modified `keystone.c` and `gl_optimize.c` to allow stats overlay regardless of performance mode
- **Files Modified**: 
  - `keystone.c`: Moved 'v' and 'k' key handling outside keystone dependency
  - `gl_optimize.c`: Updated `should_skip_feature_for_performance()` to respect user stats requests

### 2. Bluetooth Gamepad Responsiveness (FIXED âœ…)
- **Problem**: 8BitDo Zero 2 gamepad would become unresponsive after a while
- **Root Cause**: Linux power management was putting Bluetooth controllers to sleep
- **Solution**: Disabled power management for Bluetooth adapters and devices
- **Power Management Fix**:
  ```bash
  # Disable power management for Bluetooth adapters
  echo 'on' | sudo tee /sys/class/bluetooth/hci*/power/control
  
  # Disable power management for 8BitDo Zero 2 gamepad
  echo 'on' | sudo tee /sys/devices/platform/soc/fe201000.serial/.../*8BitDo*/power/control
  ```

## Files Created/Modified

### Core Fixes
- `keystone.c` - Fixed input handling independence from keystone mode
- `gl_optimize.c` - Fixed performance mode to respect user preferences
- `input.c` - Added (and later removed) debug output for troubleshooting
- `pickle.c` - Added (and later removed) debug output for troubleshooting

### Tools
- `tools/fix_gamepad_power.sh` - Script to disable Bluetooth power management

## Usage Instructions

### Running the Fixed Version
```bash
cd /home/dilly/Projects/pickle
make
./pickle your_video.mp4
```

### Key Controls
- **'v' key**: Toggle stats overlay (now works in all modes)
- **'k' key**: Toggle keystone mode
- **8BitDo Zero 2 Gamepad Controls**:
  - START: Toggle keystone mode
  - X button: Cycle keystone corners (TLâ†’TRâ†’BRâ†’BL)
  - B button: Toggle help overlay
  - D-pad/Left stick: Move corners
  - L1/R1: Decrease/Increase step size
  - SELECT: Reset keystone
  - HOME (Guide): Toggle border
  - START+SELECT (hold 2s): Quit

### Power Management Fix
If the gamepad becomes unresponsive again after reboot:
```bash
sudo ./tools/fix_gamepad_power.sh
```

## Technical Details

### Bluetooth Power Management Issue
- Linux automatically puts Bluetooth devices into power saving mode
- This causes gamepads to "sleep" and become unresponsive
- The fix disables autosuspend for Bluetooth controllers
- This needs to be reapplied after each reboot or gamepad reconnection

### Performance Mode Compatibility
- Performance mode (`-p` flag) previously blocked all "non-essential" features
- Now allows user-requested features like stats overlay
- Balances performance optimization with user control

## Testing Results
- âœ… Stats overlay toggles correctly with 'v' key in all modes
- âœ… 8BitDo Zero 2 gamepad maintains responsiveness
- âœ… All gamepad controls function properly
- âœ… Keystone adjustment works smoothly
- âœ… Performance mode still provides optimizations

## Next Steps
- The power management fix is temporary and needs to be rerun after reboots
- Consider creating a systemd service or udev rule for permanent fix
- Monitor for any other Bluetooth connectivity issues during extended use
